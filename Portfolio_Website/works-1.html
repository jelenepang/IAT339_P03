                <p class="bio">Tennis Goat 100 (TG100) is a Tennis-based startup company that I have been working with. The task of designing and prototyping a website was done individually by me, though I worked with a back-end developer in latter stages of the project. </p>
                <h3 class="hello">Process</h3>
                <p class="bio"> To start begin this project, I was briefed by my supervisor, the specifics of the website content. During the meeting, notes were recorded to help me keep track of all the necessary elements of the interactive website. Some of its main components included a introduction video, a specific criteria and a list of ATP and WTA Tennis players that are ranked based on that criteria. With this in mine, my goal was to design a user interface that focused on these elements whilst staying minimal but true to the company's branding. And to fully understand the company’s brand, I additionally had to communicate with the previous designer about TG100’s colours, themes, fonts, and overall ethos. <br><br>Using Figma, my supervisor approved of the draft design I had presented. With the go-ahead to move on, I further iterated my design to ensure easy user navigation throughout the website. </p>
                <h3 class="hello">Challenges and resolutions</h3>
                <p class="bio">One of the main challenges I found myself struggling with was constantly updating the website. The idea was not set in stone by my supervisor so things were changing very frequently, causing my progress and workflow to be quite stagnant at times. Because of this, I found using components in Figma to be quite useful. With this method, I could reuse designs that are used multiple times throughout the website which made me more efficient even with all the changes I was asked to make. </p>
                <h3 class="hello">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="bio">In the further stages of this project, a web developer joined our team and worked with me to code the actual website. With this addition to the team, I had to organize my files and ensure that the developer had all the graphics he needed and also promptly update the prototype as I worked so that he was on the same page as me. Overall, the project required a lot of good communication and I have found myself able to express myself more clearly and better organize my work through consistent practice. </p>
