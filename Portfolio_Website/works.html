                <h3 class="hello">Adobook</h3>
                <p class="bio">Adobook is a digital recipe book designed by a team of three including myself. This interactive system, later designed as a mobile app, functions as a database that allows users to store their recipes. </p>
                <h3 class="hello">Process</h3>
                <p class="bio">This project began with a prompt to create an interactive system. Our beginning steps were to determine our target audience. With extensive research, we first narrowed down the domain in which we wanted to work by fleshing out their goals, activities, opportunities, and challenges they may have. With a focused domain, we were able to create personas that helped with the following brainstorming stages.<br><br>During the ideation process, we came up with three directions we could move forward with. A Recipe Translator, an Online Recipe-Sharing System, and finally a Digital recipe book. After an in-class critique session, we settled on creating a digital recipe book as we felt it had the most potential.<br><br>Once our idea was flushed out, we created initial designs in Figma. The finalized design was then moved into Protopie for prototyping.</p>
                <h3 class="hello">Challenges and Resolutions</h3>
                <p class="bio">While the overall process went quite smoothly, some obstacles we ran into involved ensuring the app considered its target audience to a greater degree. For example, we initially created an app that only had functions such as adding in recipes and manually inputting the information of a recipe. During the critique sessions, we received feedback saying that this was not a good user experience considering our target users. Because our domain includes seniors who may only have hard copies of recipes, there should be an easier way for them to input data. To solve this issue, a function allowing the scanning of images and changing them into text was designed to help ease the use of the app and avoid manual input of data. More details about the project and how we tackled smaller objstacles are described.</p>
                <h3 class="hello">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="bio">Adobook turned out to be a very well-researched design that my team and I are proud of. This project taught me to work with my groupmates and to focus on work distribution as it is crucial when working with other people. Keeping each other in check was a way we could critique each others' ideas and consistently progress through the project.
